	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sidhartha Satapathy!</h1>
	<p> 
		I am a first year master's student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Science. Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I am interested in the broad area of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence . To date, I have primarily worked in Natural Language Processing domain of AI and worked on taking deep learning and machine learning-based approaches to NLP problems. <br>

		During the summer of 2017, I interned at Cogoport(international logistics) designing and developing a personal assistant for their online platform. <br>

		Prior to finding an interest in AI/NLP/ML, I interned at Oracle during the summer of 2015 developing a transpiler to convert a polymer-based component(js library) to a react-based component(js library). Furthermore, I also interned at Nomura during the summer of 2016 developing a totoro sheet(Nomura's in house front-to-back pricing and risk management system) and supporting functions for a system which could calculate the changes in risk on modifying the market. <br>
